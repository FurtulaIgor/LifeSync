export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
})
- [x] Create a basic project structure (components, styles, pages folders)
- [x] Add README with project details and setup instructions

### [x] **[Easy]** Local Storage Utility Setup
- [x] Create a utility module for managing data in local storage
- [x] Implement functions for saving, updating, deleting, and fetching task and mood data
- [x] Write documentation/comments for utility functions

  - [ ] Design UI for displaying charts (e.g., bar chart or line chart)
  - [ ] Aggregate mood and productivity data from local storage for the past week
  - [ ] Use a chart library (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts) to display data
- [ ] Integrate the Analytics Chart into the Insights & Analytics View
- [ ] Testing: Ensure chart data correctly reflects local storage data and updates as expected

## UI/UX Design

### [x] **[Easy]** Layout and Responsive Design
- [x] Define the overall layout structure with three main sections: Planner, Mood Tracker, and Insights
- [x] Use Tailwind CSS to style components with a modern, pastel-themed, rounded design
- [ ] Ensure responsive design using media queries for different devices
- [ ] Testing: Manually verify layout on desktop and mobile views

### [ ] **[Easy]** Component Styling and Consistency
- [ ] Establish a style guide (colors, typography, spacing) based on the provided UI/UX design
- [ ] Apply consistent styles to Task List, Mood Buttons, Suggestion Box, and Analytics Chart
- [ ] Testing: Review all components for visual consistency and alignment with design guidelines

## Testing

### [ ] **[Easy]** Unit Testing for Utility Functions
- [ ] Write unit tests for the local storage utility functions
- [ ] Use a testing framework like Jest to verify correct data handling

### [ ] **[Medium]** Integration Testing for Core Features
- [ ] Test integration of Task Planner with local storage operations (add, edit, delete)
- [ ] Test that mood selections are accurately recorded and reflected
- [ ] Validate that the Suggestion Engine provides dynamic outputs based on user input
- [ ] Test that weekly analytics correctly display historical data

## Deployment

### [x] **[Easy]** Development Build & Local Deployment
- [x] Set up development server (using Vite) and run the application locally
- [x] Test the application in a local environment and address any issues

### [ ] **[Medium]** Production Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Configure build scripts for production
- [ ] Optimize the application for performance (minification, asset optimization)
- [ ] Document deployment steps
- [ ] Deploy using a preferred method (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) and verify functionality

### [ ] **[Easy]** Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Set up basic error logging (console logs or a monitoring tool) to track issues
- [ ] Monitor usage to ensure features perform as expected
