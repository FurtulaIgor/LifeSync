- [x] Integrate the Suggestion Box component into the main view
- [ ] Testing: Validate suggestions update appropriately when tasks or moods change

### [x] **[Hard]** Weekly Analytics for Mood and Productivity
- [x] Develop an Analytics Chart component
  - [x] Design UI for displaying charts (e.g., bar chart or line chart)
  - [x] Aggregate mood and productivity data from local storage for the past week
  - [x] Use a chart library (Recharts) to display data
- [x] Integrate the Analytics Chart into the Insights & Analytics View
- [ ] Testing: Ensure chart data correctly reflects local storage data and updates as expected

## UI/UX Design

### [x] **[Easy]** Layout and Responsive Design
- [x] Define the overall layout structure with three main sections: Planner, Mood Tracker, and Insights
- [x] Use Tailwind CSS to style components with a modern, pastel-themed, rounded design
- [x] Ensure responsive design using media queries for different devices
- [x] Testing: Manually verify layout on desktop and mobile views

### [x] **[Easy]** Component Styling and Consistency
- [x] Establish a style guide (colors, typography, spacing) based on the provided UI/UX design
- [x] Apply consistent styles to Task List, Mood Buttons, Suggestion Box, and Analytics Chart
- [x] Testing: Review all components for visual consistency and alignment with design guidelines

## Testing

### [ ] **[Easy]** Unit Testing for Utility Functions
- [ ] Write unit tests for the local storage utility functions
- [ ] Use a testing framework like Jest to verify correct data handling

### [ ] **[Medium]** Integration Testing for Core Features
- [ ] Test integration of Task Planner with local storage operations (add, edit, delete)
- [ ] Test that mood selections are accurately recorded and reflected
- [ ] Validate that the Suggestion Engine provides dynamic outputs based on user input
- [ ] Test that weekly analytics correctly display historical data

## Deployment

### [x] **[Easy]** Development Build & Local Deployment
- [x] Set up development server (using Vite) and run the application locally
- [x] Test the application in a local environment and address any issues

### [x] **[Medium]** Production Deployment Preparation
- [x] Configure build scripts for production
- [x] Optimize the application for performance (minification, asset optimization)
- [x] Document deployment steps
- [x] Deploy using a preferred method (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) and verify functionality

### [ ] **[Easy]** Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Set up basic error logging (console logs or a monitoring tool) to track issues
- [ ] Monitor usage to ensure features perform as expected
