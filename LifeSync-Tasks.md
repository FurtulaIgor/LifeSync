- [x] Testing: Manually verify layout on desktop and mobile views

### [x] **[Easy]** Component Styling and Consistency
- [x] Establish a style guide (colors, typography, spacing) based on the provided UI/UX design
- [x] Apply consistent styles to Task List, Mood Buttons, Suggestion Box, and Analytics Chart
- [x] Testing: Review all components for visual consistency and alignment with design guidelines

## Testing

### [x] **[Easy]** Unit Testing for Utility Functions
- [x] Write unit tests for the local storage utility functions
- [x] Use a testing framework like Jest to verify correct data handling

### [x] **[Medium]** Integration Testing for Core Features
- [x] Test integration of Task Planner with local storage operations (add, edit, delete)
- [x] Test that mood selections are accurately recorded and reflected
- [x] Validate that the Suggestion Engine provides dynamic outputs based on user input
- [x] Test that weekly analytics correctly display historical data

## Deployment

### [x] **[Easy]** Development Build & Local Deployment
- [x] Set up development server (using Vite) and run the application locally
- [x] Test the application in a local environment and address any issues

### [x] **[Medium]** Production Deployment Preparation
- [x] Configure build scripts for production
- [x] Optimize the application for performance (minification, asset optimization)
- [x] Document deployment steps
- [x] Deploy using a preferred method (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) and verify functionality

### [x] **[Easy]** Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [x] Set up basic error logging (console logs or a monitoring tool) to track issues
- [x] Monitor usage to ensure features perform as expected
